# Logistic Regression From Scratch

## Overview
This project demonstrates building a logistic regression model from scratch using Python, following Lab 4 of the eCornell Machine Learning course.

## Objectives
- Understand the machine learning life cycle
- Implement logistic regression without using libraries like scikit-learn
- Train and evaluate the model

## Methodology
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Implement logistic regression from scratch using Python
3. Train the model and make predictions
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy and other metrics
5. Visualize results

## Results & Key Findings
- Model accuracy: **[Insert Accuracy]**
- Key insights from data: **[Insert Insights]**

## Next Steps
- Extend to multi-class classification
- Compare with scikit-learn implementation
- Experiment with regularization techniques

## Individual Contributions
- Completed Lab 4 individually
- Implemented logistic regression model and analysis

## Installation
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd logistic-regression-from-scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
