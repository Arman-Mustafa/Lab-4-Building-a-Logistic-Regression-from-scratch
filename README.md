# Logistic Regression From Scratch

## Overview
This project demonstrates building a logistic regression model from scratch using Python, following Lab 4 of the eCornell Machine Learning course.

## Objectives
- Understand the machine learning life cycle
- Implement logistic regression without using libraries like scikit-learn
- Train and evaluate the model

## Methodology
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Implement logistic regression from scratch using Python
3. Train the model and make predictions
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy and other metrics
5. Visualize results

## Results & Key Findings
- Model accuracy: **[Insert Accuracy]**
- Key insights from data: **[Insert Insights]**

## Next Steps
- Extend to multi-class classification
- Compare with scikit-learn implementation
- Experiment with regularization techniques

## Individual Contributions
- Completed Lab 4 individually
- Implemented logistic regression model and analysis

The dataset used in this lab is too large to host on GitHub. You can download it here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K4qOfPSHDC-PMMBcRsJ7GWnYtMYPms2V/view?usp=sharing) and place it in a folder named data/ in the repository before running the notebook.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Lab4-LogisticRegression.git
cd Lab4-LogisticRegression

2. Create a Python virtual environment 
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

3. manually install the main libraries:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

# 4 **Run the notebook
Place the dataset in the data/ folder (or download from the link in the README).
Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook LogisticRegressionFromScratch.ipynb
